// Problem Statement
// In the enchanted forest of Snoopville, the wise owl known as Orlon is the guardian of the mystical treasure. Every year, Orlon holds a challenge to find the worthy adventurer who can solve the riddles of the forest and earn the treasure.

// The challenge is simple but requires both wit and knowledge of the forestâ€™s magical rules. The adventurer must speak a word aloud within 5 seconds after the bell rings. However, only those who meet the conditions of the forest will qualify for the treasure hunt.

// To qualify for the next round of the challenge, the word spoken by the adventurer must:

// Contain at least 2 vowels.
// The number of consonants in the word must be a perfect square of a prime number (from the sequence: 2^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 11^2, 13^2, 17^2, 19^2,.......).
// if the word has no consonants, the adventurer will be disqualified.
// As the judge of the challenge, your task is to determine whether each adventurer qualifies for the next stage based on their word.

// Input Format
// The only line of input contain a single word consisting of uppercase or lowercase alphabets.

// Output Format
// Print "Qualify" if the adventurer qualifies, otherwise print "Disqualify".
